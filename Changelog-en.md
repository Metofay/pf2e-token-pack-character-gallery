[![Boosty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Boosty-Metofay?logo=boosty&color=%23FFFFFF)](https://boosty.to/metofay)

## Version 1.1.0
1. Added AP Shades of Blood
2. Added Bestiaries, Monster Core lacked art, had to add manually and write approximate tags. These art are in a separate folder
3. Added NPC Core
4. Added Beginner Box
5. Added AP Abomination Vaults
6. Some art is missing tags, it was written as "", I deleted them, since the localization broke a little.
7. Added missing tags, pay special attention to checking the rarity of races, could screw up
8. Still, the Gallery will be a completely independent module, but with the ability to integrate into the main one (just the settings will be registered in the main module)
9. Removed duplicates, made so that Bestiaries and Npc Core are a priority. There are just a lot of identical additions that are the same thing, but at the same time, they break tags if different ones are written
10. Reviewed all the tags so that they were working, their translation with the translation of the Doctor (what I could find), and also corrected their spelling in the actors themselves
11. Sorted tags alphabetically in the downloaded localization file (I did not check a separate localization file via babele)
12. Corrected the rendering of the tag list so that it does not constantly send to the very top when opening lists
