## 🐲 About the module

This additional module for **Foundry VTT** adds the Character Gallery to the **Pathfinder 2e** system. It works both separately and with the integration of the main module [**Pathfinder 2E: Token Pack**](https://github.com/Metofay/pf2e-token-pack).

## ⚙️ Module functionality

In addition to simply adding content, the module offers several powerful tools:

### 1. Character Gallery
Adds a new mechanic of a large, fully localized library of art "Character Gallery" for images that are not in the standard compendiums.
